  * Now in its Fifth Edition, this text provides a comprehensive and wellness-oriented approach to the theory and practice of gerontologic nursing. Organized around the author's unique "functional consequences theory" of gerontologic nursing, the book explores "normal" age-related changes and risk factors that often interfere with optimal health and functioning, to effectively identify and teach health-promotion interventions.
 
  * The author provides research-based background information and a variety of practical assessment and intervention strategies for use in every clinical setting. Highlights of this edition include expanded coverage of evidence-based practice, more first-person stories, new chapters, and clinical tools such as assessment tools recommended by the Hartford Institute of Geriatric Nursing.
